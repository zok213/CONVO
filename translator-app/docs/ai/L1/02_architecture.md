# 02 Architecture

> Runtime architecture for browser RTC/RTM, Next.js route handlers, and Agora managed agent session.

## High-Level Shape

- Next.js App Router frontend and API routes in one deployable app.
- Browser joins Agora RTC channel and uses RTM for transcript/state/metrics/errors.
- Server-side routes mint token and call Agora Agent Server SDK.
- Agent executes STT -> LLM -> TTS pipeline in Agora cloud.
- Optional Solana audit trail: translation sessions compute SHA-256 hash of bilingual transcript, sent to Solana devnet via Memo program instructions for immutable verification.

## Component Graph

```text
Browser UI (LandingPage + ConversationComponent)
  -> GET /api/generate-agora-token
  -> POST /api/invite-agent
  -> RTC join/publish mic
  -> RTM subscribe + AgoraVoiceAI events
  -> POST /api/log-session (on end)
  -> POST /api/solana/record (on end, Demo mode)

Next.js API routes
  -> agora-token (RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithRtm)
  -> agora-agents (start/stop managed agent)
  -> log-session (session metadata logging)
  -> solana/record (send hash to Solana devnet via @solana/web3.js + Memo program)

Solana Devnet
  -> Memo program pre-deployed at MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr
  -> Transaction memo stores JSON: { h: hex_hash, t: timestamp, c: channel, d: domain, m: msg_count }

Agora Cloud
  -> Agent session (Deepgram STT + OpenAI LLM + MiniMax TTS by default)
  -> RTM payloads (transcript, state, metrics, error)
```

## Start Sequence

1. UI fetches RTC+RTM token and channel.
2. UI invites agent and initializes RTM in parallel.
3. UI mounts conversation view.
4. `useJoin` connects RTC once `isReady` guard passes.
5. `AgoraVoiceAI.init()` subscribes transcript/state/metrics streams.

## End Sequence

1. UI calls `/api/stop-conversation` with `agent_id` if present.
2. UI logs out RTM client.
3. RTC hook ownership handles leave/unpublish cleanup.
4. Component state resets to pre-call shell.

## Core State Domains

- Session bootstrap: `LandingPage` (`agoraData`, `rtmClient`, loading/error flags).
- RTC transport and mic: `ConversationComponent` + `agora-rtc-react` hooks.
- Transcript + agent state: `AgoraVoiceAI` events mapped through `lib/conversation.ts`.
- Metrics and connection issues: `AGENT_METRICS`, `MESSAGE_ERROR`, `SAL_STATUS`, RTM fallback parsing.

## External Dependencies

- `agora-rtc-react` / `agora-rtc-sdk-ng` for media transport.
- `agora-rtm` for data channel.
- `agora-agent-client-toolkit` and `agora-agent-uikit` for conversation logic/UI.
- `agora-agents` for managed agent lifecycle.

## Deployment Modes

- Local development via `pnpm run dev`.
- Vercel deployment as single Next.js app with server env vars.

## Data and Control Boundaries

- Browser never sees the app certificate; only receives signed short-lived tokens.
- Agent lifecycle control (`start`, `stop`) is server-routed.
- Transcript/state/metrics are data-plane RTM events from agent to browser.
- UI control-plane actions (start/end, renew) originate in `LandingPage`.

## Internal Interfaces Between Components

`LandingPage` -> `ConversationComponent` props:

- `agoraData` (`token`, `uid`, `channel`, optional `agentId`)
- `rtmClient` (already logged-in and subscribed)
- `onTokenWillExpire(uid)` callback for dual-token renewal
- `onEndConversation()` callback for teardown and route stop call

`ConversationComponent` -> child UI components:

- normalized transcript items and current in-progress turn
- agent visualizer state derived from transport + semantic state
- connection issue list and derived severity
- recent metric window for stage latency chips

## Why the App Router Structure Matters

- API handlers under `app/api` co-deploy with UI and share env management.
- Client components isolate browser-only SDK usage via dynamic import and `ssr: false`.
- This avoids SSR-side access to WebRTC-dependent modules.

## Change Impact Hints

- Changes to token or invite routes affect both startup and renewal paths.
- Changes to transcript mapping can break both transcript panel and visualizer semantics.
- Changes to RTM setup in `LandingPage` affect toolkit subscription readiness.
